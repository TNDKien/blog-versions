# blog-versions

These are the versions of the blog project that I have created.

## [Version 1: Sidebar Navigation from v0](./Blog%20V1)

- Used v0 to create a homepage and sidebar navigation for the blog. Since the rest of the blog it created was not what I wanted, I decided to start over with just the sidebar navigation.

## [Version 2: Basic Blog Setup](./Blog%20V2)

- Created a basic blog setup with a homepage and sidebar navigation in Storyblok. Making sure the sidebar is seperated from the content.

## [Version 3: Advanced Functionality with Article Pages](./Blog%20V3)

- Created a component that shows all article pages, updating whenever a new article is created. This is something I've learned from a previous project.

## [Version 4: Comment System](./Blog%20V4)

- I've asked for feedback on the blog to my teachers and they suggested making a blog about the things I like. After that, I was looking around at other blogs and I saw that they had a comment system. I wanted to add one to my blog, but I didn't know how to do it. So I asked v0 to create a comment system for the blog. Using an API route to save the comments to a JSON file. I've tested it in the local environment and it works, but found out it doesn't work in the production environment when hosted on Vercel.

## [Version 5: Final Polish](./Blog%20V5)

- In this version, I've asked with chatGPT for suggestions on other ways to make a comment system. It suggested using a database to save the comments. I've created a database in Supabase and connected it to the blog. I've also created a comment component that shows the comments for an article.
